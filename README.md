# VIRAT-KHOLI-SCORE-CARD-DASHBOARD-PROJECT

Creating a dashboard of Virat Kohli's IPL performance from 2008 to 2020 using Power BI, and importing data from a SQL database is a comprehensive task. Below is a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:

Step 1: Data Import
Connect to your SQL database from Power BI.
Import tables containing Virat Kohli's IPL performance data, such as matches, innings, runs, etc.
Step 2: Data Preparation
Clean and transform the data as needed. This might include handling missing values, converting data types, and creating calculated columns or measures.
Ensure that the data model is properly structured, with appropriate relationships between tables.
Step 3: Dashboard Design
Open a new report in Power BI.
Design the layout of your dashboard. Consider adding multiple pages or sections for different aspects of Kohli's performance (e.g., overall stats, season-wise stats, match-wise stats).
Use Power BI advance tools such as slicers, scrollbars, and filters to enhance interactivity.
Step 4: Visualization
Create visualizations based on the data. Examples include:
Line charts showing Kohli's runs scored over each IPL season.
Bar charts comparing his performance metrics (e.g., runs, average, strike rate) across different seasons.
Pie charts showing the distribution of his scores (e.g., number of centuries, half-centuries, and other scores).
Utilize Power BI's extensive library of visualizations and customize them to suit your needs.
Step 5: Interactivity
Add slicers, scrollbars, and filters to allow users to interact with the data dynamically.
Use bookmarks and buttons to create navigation within the dashboard.
Incorporate tooltips and drill-through functionality to provide additional details when users hover over or click on specific data points.
Step 6: Wallpaper and Themes
Customize the appearance of your dashboard by adding wallpaper images, logos, or color themes.
Ensure that the design is visually appealing and consistent throughout the dashboard.
Step 7: Testing and Refinement
Test the dashboard thoroughly to ensure all visualizations and interactive elements are functioning correctly.
Gather feedback from users and stakeholders and make necessary refinements to improve usability and clarity.
Step 8: Deployment
Publish the dashboard to the Power BI Service or embed it in other applications or websites for wider access.
Share the dashboard with relevant stakeholders and users, ensuring appropriate permissions are set.
By following these steps, you can create a comprehensive dashboard of Virat Kohli's IPL performance using Power BI, with advanced tools and features to enhance interactivity and visualization.


PROBLEM STATEMENT - 
1. Analysis of Virat's top 5 ground performance in the year 2021?
2. Analyze Virat batting performance data and show great performance monthly and quarterly in the year 2018?
3. In which opposition team did Virat have the most top 5 batting performance in the year 2021?
4. How many cricket matches did Virat play for India in the year 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020?
With the help of slicer, it is easy to filter by single click on report or dashboard that is deployed on power bi.
